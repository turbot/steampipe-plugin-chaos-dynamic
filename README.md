## Quick start

Install the plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```shell
steampipe plugin install chaosdynamic
```

Setup connection config($INSTALL_DIR/.steampipe/config):

```hcl
connection "chaosdynamic"{
  plugin = "chaosdynamic"
  tables = [
    {
      name    = "test1"
      columns = [
        {
          name = "c1"
          type = "string"
        },
        {
          name = "c2"
          type = "string"
        },
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Run a query:

```sql
select
  *
from
  chaosdynamic.test1;
```
